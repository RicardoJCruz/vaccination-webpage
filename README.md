Webpage made with HTML and CSS
[Available here](https://ricardojcruz.github.io/vaccination-webpage/)

Made for a practice proposed by [Launch X](https://github.com/LaunchX-InnovaccionVirtual)

The objective of this practice was to recreate a [design](./landingVacunaci%C3%B3n.png) by [Adhiari Subekti](https://dribbble.com/Adhiari_is) using HTML and CSS and get a result as close to the original. This design is for the main page of a vaccination website, getting the COVID-19 vaccine and its reinforcements is very important because that is the fastest way to ensure the end of this pandemic.

In this practice we focused on two important aspects of front-end development:

  1. Marketing Campaign. Once we have our website all set-up how can we make people get to it. I designed a simple marketing campaign considering ways to get        people to know about the page.

  2. CSS. After writing the HTML the next step was to style it, and the goal was to get as close to the original design as possible.
